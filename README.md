# 🤖 SachdevaAI Jarvis — Voice-Based AI Assistant

An advanced **voice-based AI assistant** built using **Python**, **LangChain**, and **LiveKit**, designed and developed by **Gaurav Sachdeva**.  
Jarvis interacts with users in **natural Hinglish (Hindi + English)** — just like how modern Indians talk every day — with reasoning capabilities powered by **LangChain Agent Mode**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SachdevaAI Jarvis** is not just another chatbot — it’s a thinking assistant.  
It can:
- Understand Hinglish (mix of Hindi and English)
- Speak fluently with personality and humor
- Fetch real-time information (Date, City, Weather)
- Use reasoning and tools via **LangChain Agents**
- Respond naturally through voice using **LiveKit**

This project demonstrates how to connect real-world tools with LLMs to build a contextual, voice-enabled, reasoning assistant.
