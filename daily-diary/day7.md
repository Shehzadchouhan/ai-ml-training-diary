# 📘 Day 7 – 02/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Today’s focus was on **data cleaning and preprocessing techniques**.
- Explored handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- Used `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, and `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn`.
- Worked on a student marks dataset to apply preprocessing practically.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- ML models perform poorly without proper preprocessing.
- Encoding is needed to convert text data into numeric form.
- Scaling brings all features to the same level of importance.
- Pipelines can automate preprocessing steps.

### 📝 Notes:
- Applied label encoding to convert 'gender' and 'course' columns into numeric values.
- Learned that data cleaning is time-consuming but highly important.
- Also read about outliers and why they need to be removed.
