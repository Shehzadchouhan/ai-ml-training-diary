# 📘 Day 9 – 04/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Deep-dived into the **Linear Regression project**: “Student Marks Predictor”.
- Collected a real dataset with columns like `Hours Studied` and `Marks Scored`.
- Applied preprocessing, split data into train/test, trained the model, and evaluated it.
- Learned to use `train_test_split`, `LinearRegression()`, `r2_score`.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Evaluating model performance using `R² score` and `Mean Squared Error`.
- Importance of avoiding overfitting by splitting data properly.
- Plotted the prediction line to visually analyze accuracy.

### 📝 Notes:
- Trainer suggested documenting this project as our **mini project**.
- Pushed my first working ML project to GitHub 🚀
- Feeling more confident in applying what I’ve learned so far.
