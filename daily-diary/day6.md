# 📘 Day 6 – 01/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Continued learning Python libraries for ML — today’s focus was on **Pandas**.
- Understood how to create and manipulate **DataFrames** and **Series**.
- Learned how to read `.csv` files and clean datasets.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample student dataset.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- `pd.read_csv()` is used to import data for processing.
- `head()`, `tail()`, `describe()`, `info()` are useful for quick insights.
- Handling missing values using `fillna()` or `dropna()` is crucial.
- Indexing and filtering data with conditions.

### 📝 Notes:
- Pandas makes data handling super easy and intuitive.
- It’s amazing how just a few lines of code can summarize large data.
- Trainer explained the importance of data preprocessing before model building.
