# 📘 Day 11 – 06/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Revised logistic regression and classification basics.
- Explored **evaluation metrics** for classification models:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Implemented evaluation on a sample binary classification model.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Accuracy isn’t always the best metric (especially in imbalanced datasets).
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP), Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
- F1-Score balances both precision and recall.

### 📝 Notes:
- Used `sklearn.metrics` for evaluation.
- Visualized the confusion matrix using Seaborn heatmap.
- Trainer gave a real-world example of cancer prediction: prefer high recall to catch actual positives.
