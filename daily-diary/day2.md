# 📘 Day 2 – 27/06/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Started the day by revising yesterday’s concepts (AI, ML, DL).
- Our trainer introduced **types of Machine Learning** with real-life examples.
- Explored:
  - **Supervised Learning** (e.g., predicting student marks)
  - **Unsupervised Learning** (e.g., customer segmentation)
  - **Reinforcement Learning** (e.g., self-driving cars)
- Watched a video tutorial on linear regression and classification problems.
- Completed a small quiz on types of learning.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Supervised ML = Data + Labels
- Unsupervised ML = Data only
- Reinforcement = Agent learns from environment using reward/punishment
- Difference between regression and classification

### 📝 Notes:
- Learned that most real-world ML projects use supervised learning.
- Trainer gave real examples like spam detection, stock prediction, etc.
- Feeling more comfortable with the ML ecosystem now!
