# 📘 Day 5 – 30/06/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Introduction to **NumPy** – the numerical computing library in Python.
- Learned about arrays, array slicing, and basic operations.
- Practiced NumPy functions: `np.array()`, `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.sum()`, etc.
- Compared Python list vs NumPy array performance.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- NumPy arrays are faster and more memory efficient than lists.
- Broadcasting allows operations between different shaped arrays.
- Useful in ML for handling large datasets and performing matrix operations.

### 📝 Notes:
- NumPy syntax felt strange initially, but documentation is very helpful.
- Completed a small exercise to perform statistics on student marks.
- Excited to explore Pandas library next!
