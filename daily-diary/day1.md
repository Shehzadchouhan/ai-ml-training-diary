# 📘 Day 1 – 26/06/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Today was the first day of my AI/ML summer training at **ThinkNEXT Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**
- The trainer gave an overview of the entire 1-month course structure and outcomes.
- Introduction session on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**.
- Discussed the importance of data in AI systems.
- Understood how AI is already a part of our daily life (e.g., Google Assistant, Netflix recommendations, self-driving cars).
- Watched real-world demo videos to understand where ML is applied in companies like Amazon, Tesla, etc.
- Explored the roadmap that we will follow during this training.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- **AI** is a broader concept that aims to make machines intelligent.
- **ML** is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data.
- **Deep Learning** is a subset of ML using neural networks for complex tasks.
- Key difference between AI, ML, and DL.
- How data is considered the “new oil” in this era.

### 📝 Notes:
- The course seems well-structured and covers everything from basics to project implementation.
- Trainer suggested we maintain a GitHub daily diary — I created a GitHub repo for that today.
- Looking forward to learning Python basics tomorrow.
- It was a light but informative day to kickstart this journey!
