# 📘 Day 16 – 11/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Learned about **Hierarchical Clustering**.
- Compared with K-Means – no need to define K in advance.
- Built dendrograms using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Agglomerative clustering is bottom-up merging.
- Dendrogram helps visualize how clusters are formed.
- Used `linkage` and `dendrogram` functions.

### 📝 Notes:
- Practiced clustering on iris dataset.
- Visualized dendrogram and cut-off to find ideal clusters.
