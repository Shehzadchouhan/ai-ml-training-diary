# 📘 Day 8 – 03/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Introduction to **Supervised Learning** in practice.
- Trainer explained the **Linear Regression** algorithm.
- Learned the formula, concept of best-fit line, slope, intercept, and cost function.
- Implemented a basic linear regression model using `sklearn`.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes.
- The model tries to minimize the difference between actual and predicted values (MSE).
- `scikit-learn` provides ready-made functions for training and predicting.

### 📝 Notes:
- Created a marks prediction model using just hours of study.
- Visualized results using `matplotlib`.
- Realized that even simple models can provide powerful predictions if trained properly.
