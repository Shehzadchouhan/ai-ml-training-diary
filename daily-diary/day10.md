# 📘 Day 10 – 05/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Learned about **Classification algorithms**.
- Covered **Logistic Regression** for binary classification problems.
- Compared Linear vs Logistic Regression with examples.
- Implemented a simple logistic regression model to classify pass/fail based on marks.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Logistic Regression predicts probabilities between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function.
- It’s useful when the output is Yes/No, Pass/Fail, etc.
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used for evaluation.

### 📝 Notes:
- Started working on a classification version of the student performance project.
- Trainer gave examples like spam detection and disease diagnosis.
- Learned that Logistic Regression is the base of many classification techniques.
