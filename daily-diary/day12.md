# 📘 Day 12 – 07/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Introduction to **Decision Trees** and how they work.
- Learned concepts like:
  - Splitting
  - Information Gain
  - Gini Index
  - Leaf Nodes
- Implemented a decision tree classifier using `sklearn`.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Decision trees are easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
- `max_depth`, `min_samples_split` can be used to prune trees.
- Visualizing trees helps in understanding the model's decision-making.

### 📝 Notes:
- Built a model to classify students as pass/fail using marks and attendance.
- Used `plot_tree()` for visualizing splits.
- Trainer shared pros and cons of tree-based models.
