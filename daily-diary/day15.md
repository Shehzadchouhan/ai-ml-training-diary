# 📘 Day 14 – 09/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Started learning **Unsupervised Learning**.
- Focused on **Clustering Algorithms** — especially **K-Means Clustering**.
- Implemented a clustering model to group students based on study time and marks.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Unsupervised learning is used when we don’t have labeled data.
- K-Means tries to group similar data points into clusters using Euclidean distance.
- `elbow method` helps decide the number of clusters (K).

### 📝 Notes:
- Used `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`.
- Visualized clusters using scatter plot and color-coded groups.
- Understood that clustering is widely used in market segmentation, recommendations, etc.
