# 📘 Day 13 – 08/07/2025

### 📅 Activities Performed:
- Learned about **Random Forest** – an ensemble method.
- Understood the concept of **Bagging** and **Multiple Decision Trees**.
- Built a random forest model using `RandomForestClassifier`.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Random Forest reduces overfitting by averaging results of multiple trees.
- Good for both classification and regression problems.
- Provides `feature_importances_` to see which input features matter most.

### 📝 Notes:
- Used student dataset to train random forest and compare accuracy with single tree.
- Accuracy improved with Random Forest.
- Read that Random Forest works well in most real-world problems.
